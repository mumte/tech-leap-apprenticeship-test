# Debugging Question

### What's wrong with the code?
The issue is that the loop modifies the list (`numbers`) while iterating over it.  
When elements are removed, the list length changes and some elements are skipped.

### What will it output?
It will likely output: `[2, 3, 5]`  
(but this depends on how Python shifts indexes during removal).

### How to fix it:
We should remove even **values**, not indexes, and avoid modifying the list during iteration.

### Corrected Code:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 != 0]
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 3, 5]
