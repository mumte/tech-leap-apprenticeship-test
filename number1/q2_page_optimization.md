# Page Optimization

When a page loads too slowly, it affects user experience and SEO.  
Here are three common causes and how to fix them:

1. **Large Image Sizes**
   - **Cause:** Uncompressed or oversized images take longer to load.
   - **Fix:** Use image compression tools (like TinyPNG or WebP format) and serve images in the correct size.

2. **Unoptimized JavaScript and CSS**
   - **Cause:** Large or render-blocking scripts slow down initial loading.
   - **Fix:** Minify and combine CSS/JS files, and use asynchronous or deferred loading for non-critical scripts.

3. **No Caching or CDN**
   - **Cause:** Every user request loads resources directly from the server.
   - **Fix:** Implement browser caching and use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront to serve static files closer to the user.


**Summary:**
To optimize page performance, I would compress resources, reduce unnecessary code, and leverage caching/CDN to deliver content faster.
